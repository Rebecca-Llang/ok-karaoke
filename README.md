# OK Karaoke üé§

OK Karaoke is a full-stack web app that allows users to create, manage and sing along to their own karaoke playlists.
This app includes user authentication, an easy to use form for adding songs including the karaoke singer's name, and playlist management features. Users can filter songs by genre, decade or the karaoke singer's name for karaoke parties. Let the fun begin!
